# Building Amazon Recommendation System for 25K Products

## Introduction 

Hello everyone, 

I am excited to share the details of a project my team and I developed as part of the Amazon Hackathon challenge organized for UCLA MSBA students in the Fall of 2020. The challenge required us to build a recommendation system for products using a dataset containing 25,000 products and 26 features. 

## Data 

The dataset consists of 25,000 rows and 26 features, owned by Amazon. The columns are: 

- product id 
- brand 
- bullet_point 
- color 
- item_id 
- item_name
- model_name 
- model_number 
- model_year 
- product_type 
- style 
- item_keywords 
- country 
- marketplace 
- item_weight 
- material 
- fabric_type 
- product_description 
- pattern 
- finish_type 
- item_shape
- item_height
- item_length 
- item_width 
- cleaned_description 
- product_category
